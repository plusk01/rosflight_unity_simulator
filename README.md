ROSflight Unity Simulation Environment
======================================

This package is based on [Unity](https://unity.com), a cross-platform 3D game engine with a C# scripting interface. Using Unity's physics and rendering engine allows for photo-realistic robotics simulations.

In particular, this package provides a lightweight simulation environment for software-in-the-loop (SIL) [ROSflight](https://rosflight.org) simulations, via the [`rosflight_unity`](https://github.com/plusk01/rosflight_unity) ROS package.
